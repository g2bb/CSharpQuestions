# CSharpQuestions

1. It can be used to organize classes or make sure you don't run out of class or method names
2. Value types help keep your data organized by distinguishing between simple numbers, strings, or boolean. This also means they can act differently and acomplish different tasks
3. These contain refrences to data whereas value types contain the data themselves
4. This makes it possible for client code fo create objects that are auto implemented into your code
5. Allows for syntax to rlease unmanaged resources
6. A type that can be multiple things such as an int or a string without explisitly stating that it is one or the other
7. Checks if the type of an object is compatable with another type
8. Allows a class or method to be defined with a type T
9. Public,Private,Protected,Internal,&ProtectedInternal Access Specifiers,  
10. Yes by using the params keyword
11. using `foreach (<Value Type> name in Array);`
12. Nulls can represent all the values of an unterlying as well as a null value. The prupose is to allow you to represent a type that hasn't been defined
13. Used to assign name or string values to constants to make it easier to read/maintain

15. No
16. Works much like a cast, except it will return an exception if it fails
17. An instance of a class created dynamically
18. Structs: are value types, can not have null refrences, and don't support inheritance. Class: refrence types, Can have null refrences, can support inheritance
19. Breaks terminate a loop moving on to the next part, Continues skip the rest of the loop, but the loop keeps going (ie: Loop{1,2,3, continue, 4,5,6} runs 1,2,3 and then restarts the loop)
20. used to refer to the current instance of the class
